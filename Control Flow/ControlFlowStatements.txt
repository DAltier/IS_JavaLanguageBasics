Questions

1. The most basic control flow statement supported by the Java programming language is the _if-then_ statement.
2. The _switch_ statement allows for any number of possible execution paths.
3. The _do-while_ statement is similar to the while statement, but evaluates its expression at the _bottom_ of the loop.
4. How do you write an infinite loop using the for statement? 
      Answer: for ( ; ; ) {

              }
5. How do you write an infinite loop using the while statement?
      Answer: while(true) {

              }


Exercises

Consider the following code snippet.

        if (aNumber >= 0)
            if (aNumber == 0)
                System.out.println("first string");
        else System.out.println("second string");
        System.out.println("third string");

1. What output do you think the code will produce if aNumber is 3?  
        Answer: second string 
                third string

2. Write a test program containing the previous code snippet; make aNumber 3. What is the output of the program? Is it what you predicted? Explain why the output is what it is; in other words, what is the control flow for the code snippet?
        class Test {

          public static void main(String[] args) {
            int aNumber = 3;

            if (aNumber >= 0)
                if (aNumber == 0) System.out.println("first string");
            else System.out.println("second string");
            System.out.println("third string");
          }

        }

        Output: second string 
                third string

        3 is greater than or equal to 0, so the next if statement is executed.
        3 is not equal to 0, so the next else statement is executed, which prints "second string"
        then the final print statement is executed, since it is outside of the conditional, printing "third string"

3. Using only spaces and line breaks, reformat the code snippet to make the control flow easier to understand.
Use braces, { and }, to further clarify the code.
        if (aNumber >= 0) {
            if (aNumber == 0) {
                System.out.println("first string");
            } else {
              System.out.println("second string");
            }
        }
        System.out.println("third string");
